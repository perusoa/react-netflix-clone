# Netflix React Clone

Simple netflix clone using React and TMDB API to pull in movies/tv shows.
Uses Material UI for the frontend. Still a work in progress!

Demo: [React Flix](http://reactflix.anthonyperuso.me/)

## Setup

Add a `.env.local` file. And add a `REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY` variable with your TMDB API Key which you can get one here: [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

```
REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```
